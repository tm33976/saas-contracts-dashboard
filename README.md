# 📊 SaaS Contracts Dashboard

A **Frontend Developer assignment project** by **Tushar Mishra**.

This project is a clean, modern, and responsive single-page application that simulates a **SaaS contracts management dashboard**. The goal was to create a smooth and intuitive user experience, covering the journey from login to detailed contract insights.

## ✨ Key Features

  A simple and clean login screen to demonstrate form handling and conditional navigation.  
  _(Password: `test123`)_

- **📑 Comprehensive Dashboard**  
  View a list of all contracts with **real-time search**, **status/risk filters**, and **pagination**.

- **🔍 Detailed Contract View**  
  Click on any contract to see a breakdown of its **metadata, key clauses, and AI-generated insights**.

- **📂 Simulated File Upload**  
  An interactive modal with **drag-and-drop functionality** to simulate uploading new contract files.

- **🚧 Polished Placeholder Pages**  
  For sections like **"Insights"** and **"Reports"**, user-friendly “Coming Soon” pages indicate intentional navigation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Approach

- **React**  
  Built with functional components and hooks, focusing on **reusable, modular design**.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Utility-first styling for a **responsive UI**, without writing custom CSS.

- **React Router**  
  For seamless client-side navigation, including **dynamic routes** for contract details.

- **State Management**  
  Used React’s built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`) and `localStorage` for mock authentication.
